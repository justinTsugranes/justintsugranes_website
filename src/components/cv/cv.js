      <h3>About Me</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          I&#39;m currently focused on Next.js and React.js Front End Development and UX/UI Design
          with Figma.
        </li>
        <li>
          I&#39;m fascinated with the major developments being made with cloud computing, machine
          learning, smart contracts, DeFi, tokenized assets, blockchain use-cases, and augmented
          reality, but I&#39;m taking all of that one-step-at-a-time since it&#39;s a little bit
          much to try to digest all at once...
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Completely Aside From Tech</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          writing songs, trading, backgammon, live shows and events, photography, hiking, camping,
          backpacking, trail-running, road trips, non-fiction books-audiobooks-podcasts-vlogs-blogs,
          sailing, snorkeling, and diving into artistic rabbit holes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Fun Facts</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Before I began coding, I was helping production companies with commercials for the 2021
          Super Bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          I blew my right hand up with dynamite when I was 9 (no joke... it took 120 stitches to put
          it back together). I went on to obtain a Master&#39;s Degree in Jazz Guitar and then
          became a guitarist for the US Army and a recording artist.
